# Random-number-generators
## Introduction
In real world, if we want to get some **random results**, we could do things like **flipping the coin** or **tossing a dice** to get the corresponding outcomes(head or tail, 1 to 6), although these events are not actually random, they involve so many physical factors(e.g. gravity, air resistance, or humidity, etc...) that they are nearly impossible to predict or control.
However, computers aren't designed to take advantage of these physics properties, that is, computers can **NOT** toss a coin or dice, we need to design some **algorithms** so that the results looks random. 

To simulate randomness, programs typically use a **pseudo-random number generator**. A **pseudo-random number generator** (abbreviate it as **PRNG**) is an **algorithm** that generates a sequence of numbers whose properties simulate **a sequence of random numbers**.
